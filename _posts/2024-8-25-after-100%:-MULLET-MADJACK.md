Just finished Getting all achievements for mullet madjack and just wanted to talk about it :P

YOUR HEALTH IS TIME.
YOU MUST KILL TO GET MORE TIME.

MULLET MADJACK is a fast paced cyberpunk action "roguelite" where you are livestreaming and have 10 seconds to entertain the viewers (aka killing enemies) or else youll die.

and as said by the devs themselves: "90% ARCADE FUN, 10% roguelite."

the game has you killing robots stylishly, fighting bosses, and drinking soda.

i dont have much other to say, so lets stop with the introduction :P

## Part 2 - Art Style <a name='part2'></a>

The game is inspired by old ANIME (you can, obsiously tell just by looking at it lmao). and it takes HEAVY inspiration from it. iirc, mainly neon genisis.

me personally, love the art style. as it blends in with how this game is "cyberpunk"ish, and is pretty cool and is just beautiful.

you can tell the devs put some good work on making this game look as it is.

so good, in fact, i dont even remember a single thing that looked bad.
this games art style is just "AWESOME". no other way to put it.

the people who have done the art did a great job and hope they do more awesome art for other games :)

(P.S: every girl in this game is bad af, would smash)

## Part 3 - Plot <a name='part2'></a>

ill try to keep this short so i dont give spoilers but eh whatever.

its the year 2095... and smart robots named "robillionares" have taken over the whole world!

they are so smart in fact... alright idk if its a spoiler. ANYWAYS

humans want dopamine! every. 10. seconds. they are literally addicted to dopamine.

and peace corp decides to hire a new mod, "JACK BANHAMMER." (hes the guy you play as ;) )

they have hired him to save a "influencer princess" from a giant robot in exchange for a new pair of shoes! (he was still wearing old ass boots :((( )

so its up to him to save huma- oh wait wrong game. SO ITS UP TO HIM TO SAVE THE INFLUENCER PRINCESS! (idk why they called her influencer princess lmao)

## Part 4 - Gameplay <a name='part2'></a>
Now let me tell you, this game is fucking sick.

iirc, you are powered by viewers dopamine. you have 10 seconds left to live, but everytime you kill an enemy (or drink life soda) you get some seconds back. 

oh yeah, and you have all sorts of weapons to fuck these enemies up.

you want just a regular generic pistol? fuck it you SPAWN with it!

want to use a rifle? sure! get it!

want to use a FUCKING RAILGUN? you can do that!

want to use a katana? whos stopping you!

want to use your hands as a weapon? uh... sure!


the gameplay is like this:
each level has 10 floors, and if you die on one of the floors you go back to the start of the level.

so basically, a level is split onto 10 parts. and if you die on one of the parts, you go back to part one of the level!

each time you complete a floor, you get to choose 1 between 3 shop items!
2 perks, 1 weapon.

you also have "finishers" which are items you pick up from tables and shit in the floor and one kill enemies with it. even recharges your time health or whatever.

the enemies are fairly balanced, even the bosses too.

the gameplay isnt repetitive, boring, or any of all of that stuff.

its genuienly just awesome!

## Part 5 - 100% Completion <a name='part2'></a>

like i said in the title and start, i recently got all steam achievements for it.

lets talk about that proccess.

it has you beating the game around 3-4 times depending on what difficulty you chose.

you have to beat it once on "NO TIMER!",
once on "CHALLENGE MODE" (the difficulty the devs intended),
and once on "HARD MODE".

i first played it on lenient (the one below challenge.)

so i had to complete it in total around 4 times.

and these achievements were HARD for me cuz of one chapter... (except for no timer obv)

all from one chapter... chapter 6.

i think i have some kind of shit going on since EVERY TIME I PLAY THIS CHAPTER. I DIE TENS OF TIMES IF NOT HUNDREDS.

and the later chapters arent even that hard compared to it. THE BOSS FOR CHAPTER 6 ISNT EVEN THAT HARD. 

this is just basically me whining on how hard chapter 6 was for me. whatever.

youll prolly find it easier.

its also tedious since you have to beat the game around 3-4 times and it usually takes around 3 hours to beat the game.

but the proccess was really fun!
alot of them were fun and simple.

for some reason the devs made an achievement where you gotta shoot 200 people in the nuts. and why is the nutjob achievement the most achieved achievement???

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fd22e51-db7e-4380-bbb9-669ccc9c30f5)

this game is def worth to 100%. its fun, its fast, and it also gives a challenge. 

this def gets my "sams seal of achievements approval. (only given to the highest)".

## Part 6 - The Bads <a name='part2'></a>

this one will probably be really short as i dont have many cons about this game, but i do have some.

1. the last boss fight was pretty easy tbh. wish they made it harder a bit :(
2. wish this game was longer.
3. they need to add more enemies in each floor.

thats about it that i have tbh.

## Part 1 - Conclusion <a name='part1'></a>

so, after writing a whole essay about this game, i think you know my answer.

this game is DEF worth it too buy. even if it was like 40$ it would STILL be worth it.

this game is one of the best indie games that have came out this year. from the art style, to gameplay, even jacks voice lines are funny af.

this also has some of the best achievements. if you like going for that SWEET SWEET 100% ACHIEVEMENTS like me then you should def grab this!

from the weapons, to the finishers, this game is almost perfect.

this was an awesome experience that you should def try if you like stuff like ultrakill, neon white, and hotline miami

in fact i would reccomend this game to anyone that likes shooters!

RATING: 9.5/10.
