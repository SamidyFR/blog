# Been A Long Time

Hi, its been a while. mainly since i didnt have anything to talk about, and i didnt have the motivation.

All that matters is im here now.
During the past few weeks (esp last week) alot of personal stuff has happened but NEHHH who cares about that? no one even reads these! im just gonna dedicate this blog on stuff i wanna talk about in a random order. and make shit reccomendations!

## Speaking of shit recommendations, How about we recommend a few games and such? Like:



![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d5123c2-c354-42e3-8573-9928fec4dca4)

[Soundmap!](https://soundmap.gg) soundmap is a free mobile game all about collecting songs. its pokemon go, but for songs!

You go around, collecting songs and stuff.

its main feature also is the trading tab! you can trade songs for other songs or coins! 

theres also raritys for songs, (eg united in grief by kendrick lamar is RARE, but My People is uncommon) which is what makes a song worth! theres also SHINYS (eg shiny rares, shiny commons, stuff like that)

Wont talk much about it, You just have to see for yourself ;)


anyways yeah, thats about it. just one recommendation. honestly ive been getting addicted to that game, what frustrates me tho is the owners have shit servers and they go down kinda often.


## anyways yeah, back to not sounding like a sponsor (i swear i wasnt sponsored trust)

currenty, been learning some coding. specifically python. i published my first script with the idea of friends seeing it and stuff. [check it out!](
https://github.com/SamidyFR/MEMZ-Python-Recreation) 

yeah, but currently im LOVING python. so easy, yet you can do a BUNCH of shit in it. def one of the best languages to start out in.

currently, im planning on learning javascript too but thats for another day.

ive always wanted to develop stuff, i was into computers wayyyy before and im so thankfull god has given me the oppurtunity to learn.


## other blogs

i am currently working on making a new AFTER 100% but was busy with coding. it was for "SPIDER-MAN: MILES MORALES" as it was a pretty easy 100%, (its called an essential by the playstation community lmao)
and its a VERY fun game. hopefully when i stop slacking you will see that soon but who cares, nobody reads these anyways lmao.

oh yeah, i hopefully also wanna make coding-related blogs too. coding is fun to talk about AND (if someone reads these) can help someone or whatever.

with that said, hopefully the future looks great for this blog site. even if its just a fun little idea i had.


## end (ik this was a short ass blog lmao)

welp, thats all i wanted to say. ik ts short aff but what do i do? write a whole essay? but yeah, HOPEFULLY ill be more active on here. just hopefully.

as ive said, LOTS of personal stuff has happened over the past like 1-2 weeks, mainly online stuff.

anyways yeah, short as blog ik lmao

hopefully you have a good day, you're happy, still have a roof over your head, and have friends to talk to :)

much love - samidy
